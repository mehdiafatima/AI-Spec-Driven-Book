# Gazebo Examples Overview

This directory contains various example files for Gazebo simulation, including world files and URDF robot models, to help you understand and experiment with different aspects of Gazebo.

## Available Examples

### `empty_world.world`

A basic Gazebo world file that contains no objects or environments. It's useful for starting new simulations from a clean slate or for testing basic robot functionalities without environmental interference.

-   **File**: [`empty_world.world`](./empty_world.world)

### `simple_robot.urdf`

A simple Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) file for a basic robot. This model can be spawned into a Gazebo world to demonstrate robot visualization and basic interaction within the simulation environment.

-   **File**: [`simple_robot.urdf`](./simple_robot.urdf)

## Usage

These examples are designed to be integrated with ROS 2 and Gazebo for hands-on learning. Refer to Module 1 for ROS 2 fundamentals and Module 2 for Digital Twin concepts and Gazebo integration.
