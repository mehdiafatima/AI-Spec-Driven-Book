# Unity Visualization Examples (Optional)

This directory is reserved for optional Unity visualization examples for the Digital Twin module.

Unity offers powerful rendering and simulation capabilities that can complement the core ROS 2, Gazebo, and Isaac Sim examples. If this optional component is implemented, this is where relevant Unity project files, scenes, and associated documentation would reside.

## Potential Content:
-   Unity project files for robot visualization.
-   Integration examples with ROS 2 (e.g., using Unity Robotics Hub).
-   Custom scenes for digital twin visualization.
-   Instructions for setting up and running Unity examples.

## Status: Placeholder
Currently, this is a placeholder directory. Implementation of Unity examples is considered optional and will be addressed if prioritized in future development phases.
