# NVIDIA Isaac Sim Examples Overview

This directory contains various example files for NVIDIA Isaac Sim, including USD scene descriptions and Python scripts, to help you understand and experiment with different aspects of Isaac Sim workflows.

## Available Examples

### `empty_scene.usd`

A basic Universal Scene Description (USD) file that defines an empty scene in Isaac Sim. It's useful for starting new simulations or building custom environments from scratch.

-   **File**: [`empty_scene.usd`](./empty_scene.usd)

### `simple_isaac_workflow.py`

A Python script demonstrating a simple workflow in Isaac Sim. This script typically shows how to create a stage, add objects, set their properties, and run a basic simulation.

-   **File**: [`simple_isaac_workflow.py`](./simple_isaac_workflow.py)

## Usage

These examples are designed to be used with NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Refer to Module 3 for detailed instructions on how to set up Isaac Sim and execute these workflows.
