# Assessment + Lab Exercises (Weeks 1-2)

This section provides assessment questions and hands-on lab exercises designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the introductory weeks (Weeks 1-2) of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course. These exercises will help students apply their theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

## Assessment Questions

### Part 1: Multiple Choice / Short Answer

1.  What is the primary distinguishing characteristic of Physical AI compared to traditional AI?
    a) Its use of machine learning algorithms.
    b) Its ability to interact with the physical world.
    c) Its reliance on large datasets.
    d) Its focus on abstract problem-solving.

2.  Define "Embodied Intelligence" in your own words, providing one example from nature or robotics.

3.  List three key components typically found in a Physical AI system.

4.  Why does the human form factor matter for humanoid robots in human-centric environments? Provide at least two reasons.

5.  What is morphological computing, and how does it relate to embodied intelligence?

### Part 2: Critical Thinking

1.  Discuss a potential ethical concern related to the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in society. Propose a mitigation strategy for this concern.
2.  Imagine a scenario where a Physical AI system fails in a critical application (e.g., an autonomous delivery robot). What are the potential causes of failure from an embodied intelligence perspective? How might these failures be prevented through better design?
3.  Compare and contrast the challenges faced by Physical AI systems operating in the real world versus traditional AI systems operating in digital environments.

## Lab Exercises

### Lab 1: Exploring Embodiment - Simple Robot Simulation (Conceptual)

**Objective**: To conceptually understand the impact of physical form on behavior through a simple simulated robot.

**Tools**: (No specific software needed for this conceptual exercise, but discussion and design sketches are encouraged.)

**Tasks**:

1.  **Design a Simple "Robot"**:
    -   Sketch two different physical designs for a robot whose goal is to retrieve a ball from a small, enclosed space.
    -   One design should be highly specialized (e.g., a wheeled robot with a simple scoop).
    -   The other design should be more "humanoid-like" or general-purpose (e.g., a simple bipedal robot with manipulators).
2.  **Analyze Embodiment**: For each design, consider:
    -   How does its physical form help or hinder its ability to achieve the goal?
    -   What kind of sensors and actuators would each require?
    -   How would its "intelligence" be shaped by its body? (e.g., the wheeled robot might rely on path planning, while the humanoid might use manipulation).
3.  **Discuss**: Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each design in terms of:
    -   Efficiency
    -   Adaptability to different environments
    -   Ease of control
    -   Potential for embodied intelligence to emerge

### Lab 2: Introduction to a Robotics Simulation Environment (Placeholder)

**Objective**: Familiarize with a basic robotics simulation environment (e.g., Gazebo, Webots, or a simple custom simulator) and understand fundamental concepts like rigid body dynamics and sensor feedback.

**Tools**: (Specific simulator to be introduced in later modules, this lab focuses on initial exploration).

**Tasks**:

1.  **Environment Setup**: Follow instructions (to be provided later) to launch a simple empty world in a chosen simulator.
2.  **Robot Spawning**: Spawn a basic robot model (e.g., a cube with wheels) into the simulation.
3.  **Basic Control (if possible)**: Experiment with sending simple velocity commands or joint commands to the robot to observe its movement.
4.  **Sensor Observation**: Identify and interpret simple sensor data (e.g., robot's position, orientation, or contact forces).
5.  **Reflect**: Document your observations on how the robot's actions affect its environment and how sensor data reflects these changes.

**Note**: More detailed and executable lab exercises with specific software tools will be provided in subsequent modules. These initial exercises are designed for conceptual understanding and foundational setup.
